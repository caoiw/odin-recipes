# Odin Recipes

A simple multi-page recipe website built as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

## Project Summary

This project involves creating a basic recipe website with multiple linked HTML pages. Starting from a homepage (`index.html`) with links to individual recipe pages, each recipe page contains an image, description, ingredients list, and step-by-step instructions. The goal is to practice structuring HTML files and linking pages together in a small website.

## What I've Been Learning

- Basic HTML structure and boilerplate code
- Creating headings, paragraphs, and lists (ordered and unordered)
- Adding images and links
- Organizing files and folders for a website (using directories)
- Navigating between pages using relative links
- Building semantic and accessible markup for simple web pages

This project has helped me strengthen foundational web development skills essential for creating and linking content on the web.
